Level 1

In this level, I learned that a commit is used to save changes in Git. Each commit creates a new version of the project, and by making multiple commits, Git builds the complete history of the project over time.

```bash
git commit
git commit
```

Level 2

In this level, I learned that a branch allows developers to work on a new feature separately without affecting the main code. I created a new branch named bugFix and switched to it to work independently.

```bash
git branch bugFix
git checkout bugFix
```



Level 3

In this level, I learned how to merge changes from one branch into another. I first made a commit in the bugFix branch, then made a commit in the main branch, and finally merged the bugFix branch into main, which created a merge commit.

```bash
git checkout -b bugFix
git commit
git checkout main
git commit
git merge bugFix
```


Level 4

In this level, I learned that rebase is used to move commits from one branch on top of another branch to maintain a clean and linear commit history. I committed changes in the bugFix branch and then rebased it onto the main branch.

```bash
git checkout -b bugFix
git commit
git checkout main
git commit
git checkout bugFix
git rebase main
```
